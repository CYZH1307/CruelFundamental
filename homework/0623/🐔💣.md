##### Please describe the process of TCP three-way handshake.

##### SYN

The sender initiates the connection through a TCP request, providing the random 32-bit sequence number with SYN bit set on, and the TCP socket will be in the SYN-SENT state. When the receiver receives the SYN request, it transits from LISTEN state to SYN-RECEIVED, and gets ready for the second step.

##### SYN+ACK

The receiver generates another random 32-bit sequence number that might be a different one from the last SYN request, and replies with a message that both SYN and ACK bit is on. This response serves both as the acknowlegement as the first SYN request and the syncrhonization signal from the other side, making sure the communication can be carried on from either direction.

##### ACK

The sender receives the SYN+ACK response, change the states into ESTABLISHED, and acknowlege back to the receiver. Once the receiver receives this ACK, it swtiches to the ESTABLISHED state as well, at this point of time, the TCP connection is fully established and the subsequent communication can start on this connection.
