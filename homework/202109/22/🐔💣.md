# Kafka and Zookeeper

Kafka is a distributed stream processing platform, is has a cluster of broker nodes which are registered on Zookeeper, Zookeeper maintains the meta information like how many nodes are alive, which broker is storing a particular topic and the topic for a consumer group and the consumers' offset.
However, Zookeeper itself is a complicated system, which will increase the overall complexity of Kafka and the difficulties of deployment and maintenance. When the partition number increases, Zookeeper becomes the bottleneck which makes the performance and latency worse.
After the migration, Kafka will use the built-in Raft-based quorum controller to replace the Zookeeper controller, without the dependencies on Zookeeper, Kafka itself has a better performance and cleaner architecture.
