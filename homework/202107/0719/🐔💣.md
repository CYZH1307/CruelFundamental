# Redis Mass Insertion

To perform mass insertion, the naive way will be executing the `SET` command sequentially but this could be inefficient: each of the request takes the round trip between client and server which introduces transmission overhead; even if non-blocking IO is exploited to maximize the throughput, the implementation effort in terms of both handling IO as well processing response would be quite complicated.

In Redis 2.6, the pipe mode was introduced which allows the user to define their command in a well defined protocol and transfer the data massively. To use this, the user firstly needs to define the mass command in the following format:
```
*<args><cr><lf>
$<len><cr><lf>
<arg0><cr><lf>
<arg1><cr><lf>
...
<argN><cr><lf>
```
An example could be `"*3\r\n$3\r\nSET\r\n$3\r\nkey\r\n$5\r\nvalue\r\n"` which is setting `value` to `key`. We can concatenates the similar commands and form the complete mass insertion "script" then feed this to the `redis-cli` with `--pipe` flag. Then `redis-cli` would send the request in batch to the server while parsing the result in the meantime. In the end, it also sends a `ECHO` command with a random 20-character string to verify if the echoed result matches and announce the success if it does.

According to the benchmark mentioned in some [blog post](https://www.cnblogs.com/ivictor/p/5446503.html), comparing to sending the data in naive way, this pipe mode will be drastically reducing the time consumed by more than 99%.
