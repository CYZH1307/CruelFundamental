# Kafka

## Message Ordering

Kafka cluster can be set up with multiple partitions, for each partition, as long as there is one concurrent connection to the broker, the message will be ordered. For the consumer side, since the consumer will specify the offset for a particular topic, as long as the offset is maintained properly, the message will be delivered following the original order. However the order across partition is not guaranteed.

## Prevent Message Lost

For the writing part, the producer only proceed after receiving the acknowledgement indicating that all the followers successfully record down the message, this ensures the message won't get lost due to inconsistent state among followers. Since only one consumer will be consuming the same partition under a particular topic, no message will be consumed for multiple times by different consumer. The consumer can consume the message first and then commit the offset, and handle the idempotency from application level through the offset checking, this will ensure the message will eventually be consumed, and that marks the end of the message brokering process.
