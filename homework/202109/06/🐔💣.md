# RocketMQ

In distributed system, asynchronous communication helps to decouple the systems, free the caller from long blocking time for the activities whose response is unimportant, and effectively limit the rate of consumption, which will ensure a healthy load of the services.

In RocketMQ, the producer generate the message and push it to the broker for storage, and the consumers pull the correct message from the broker. The reason behind this active pulling behaviour instead of event-driven message pushing is to further ensure the third points mentioned in the last paragraph: to avoid the consumer from overload. In this case, the consumers can pull the message from the broker based on their own load and it's easier to control precisely compared to having a central coordinator to monitor the load of each nodes and assign the task. On the other hand, if pushing model is not implemented well, it's possible to keep a lot of messages piling up from a certain node, while some of the other consumers might be free and able to take more message.
