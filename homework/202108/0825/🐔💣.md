# Spin Lock

For a traditional mutex, if a thread fails to acquire a lock, it will be blocked and fall asleep until someone releases a lock and wake it up. For a spin lock, instead of getting blocked, the thread will simply runs an infinitely and keep trying to acquire the lock, so the CPU will be busy running the loop and waiting for the lock to be acquired successfully.

Spin lock should be used wisely since it could be useful when the lock is only held for a relatively smaller amount of time (e.g. in some system call), in this case, only a few rounds of retries will allow the thread to obtain the lock. However, if the lock will be held by others for a long time, then spin lock will cause a wastage of CPU resources because it simply running a plain loop and keep trying to take the lock.

In Go's mutex implementation, it calls `runtime_canSpin` to check if spinning is allowed, and call `runtime_doSpin` to execute the logic

```go
// 
for {
  // Don't spin in starvation mode, ownership is handed off to waiters
  // so we won't be able to acquire the mutex anyway.
  if old&(mutexLocked|mutexStarving) == mutexLocked && runtime_canSpin(iter) {
    // Active spinning makes sense.
    // Try to set mutexWoken flag to inform Unlock
    // to not wake other blocked goroutines.
    if !awoke && old&mutexWoken == 0 && old>>mutexWaiterShift != 0 &&
      atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32(&m.state, old, old|mutexWoken) {
      awoke = true
    }
    runtime_doSpin()
    iter++
    old = m.state
    continue
  }
  // ...
}
```

In the implementation of the `canSpin` function, the iteration must be smaller than `active_spin`, which is 4, so the spinning won't happen forever. It also checks for the number of CPU cores, if there is only one core, spinning will be disallowed. Lastly, it checks for the running `P`, if there is no free P, spinning won't happen as well.

```go
// go/src/runtime/proc.go


// Active spinning for sync.Mutex.
//go:linkname sync_runtime_canSpin sync.runtime_canSpin
//go:nosplit
func sync_runtime_canSpin(i int) bool {
	// sync.Mutex is cooperative, so we are conservative with spinning.
	// Spin only few times and only if running on a multicore machine and
	// GOMAXPROCS>1 and there is at least one other running P and local runq is empty.
	// As opposed to runtime mutex we don't do passive spinning here,
	// because there can be work on global runq or on other Ps.
	if i >= active_spin || ncpu <= 1 || gomaxprocs <= int32(sched.npidle+sched.nmspinning)+1 {
		return false
	}
	if p := getg().m.p.ptr(); !runqempty(p) {
		return false
	}
	return true
}

//go:linkname sync_runtime_doSpin sync.runtime_doSpin
//go:nosplit
func sync_runtime_doSpin() {
	procyield(active_spin_cnt)
}
```

For the actual `doSpin` function, it simply calls `procyield(30)` to keep the CPU busy for 30 clock cycles without doing any other things.
```assembly
// asm_arm64

TEXT runtime·procyield(SB),NOSPLIT,$0-0
	MOVWU	cycles+0(FP), R0
again:
	YIELD
	SUBW	$1, R0
	CBNZ	R0, again
	RET
  
  
// asm_ppc64x

TEXT runtime·procyield(SB),NOSPLIT|NOFRAME,$0-4
	MOVW	cycles+0(FP), R7
	// POWER does not have a pause/yield instruction equivalent.
	// Instead, we can lower the program priority by setting the
	// Program Priority Register prior to the wait loop and set it
	// back to default afterwards. On Linux, the default priority is
	// medium-low. For details, see page 837 of the ISA 3.0.
	OR	R1, R1, R1	// Set PPR priority to low
again:
	SUB	$1, R7
	CMP	$0, R7
	BNE	again
	OR	R6, R6, R6	// Set PPR priority back to medium-low
	RET
```
