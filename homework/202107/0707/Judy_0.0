CLustered vs. Non-clustered index

cluseter index
  one clustered index per table, but can have one clustered index on muti columns
  primary key automatically become clustered index
  index contains pointer to block but not direct data
  table records are physically reordered to match the index(order), sort data on disk
  Clustered index store pointers to block not data.
  leaf nodes are actual data itself.
  sample:
    Roll_No	Name	Gender	Mob_No
        3	sudhir	male	9675432890
        4	afzal	male	9876543210
        5	zoya	female	8976453201

  
Non-clustered index
  the data and non-clustered index are stored seperatly.
  one table can have nmuti non-clustered index
  Non-Clustered index store both value and a pointer to actual row that holds data.
  leaf nodes are not the actual data itself rather they only contains included columns
  logical order of index does not match physical stored order of the rows on disk.
  sample:
    after adding Name as non-clustered index on the table above, a new table is created
     Name	Row address
    Afzal	3452
    Sudhir	5643
    zoya	9876
