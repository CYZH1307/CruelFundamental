## 集群脑裂数据丢失 Cluster split brain

Cluster split brain can lead to data loss.

Cluster split brain refers to a situation in a distributed system where a network failure causes different parts of the cluster to become isolated and split into multiple sub-clusters. In such a scenario, without proper measures to handle data synchronization and conflict resolution, data loss can occur.

In distributed systems, multi-replica storage mechanisms are commonly used to ensure high availability and reliability. Each replica stores the same data and is used to recover data in the event of node failures. However, in the case of cluster split brain, different replicas may conflict, leading to data inconsistency.

To avoid data loss due to cluster split brain, the following strategies can be adopted:

1. Elect a primary node: Elect a primary node in the cluster and forward all write operations to that primary node to ensure data consistency. When split brain occurs, only the primary node continues to receive write operations, avoiding data conflicts between different sub-clusters.

2. Implement distributed locks: Distributed locks are a synchronization mechanism that ensures that only one node can access data at any time. During cluster split brain, use distributed locks to ensure that only one node can modify data, avoiding data conflicts.

3. Introduce a Quorum mechanism: The Quorum mechanism is a voting mechanism that requires confirmation from at least a certain number of nodes before executing a write operation. This mechanism can prevent data inconsistency in split brain scenarios because write operations can only be performed when a majority of nodes reach a consensus.

In conclusion, avoiding data loss due to cluster split brain requires the adoption of appropriate synchronization mechanisms and conflict resolution strategies. It is also important to consider the possibility of cluster split brain when designing distributed systems to prevent data loss and system unavailability.
