# Redis Cluster Hash Slot

To support horizontal scaling, redis cluster support dynamic update for the node count. Hash slot is used to control the key distribution. Redis first take the CRC16 hash of the key, and then mod 16384 to get the index. Each of the master node will take charge of a set of the index, which is stored in a `slots` byte array, each bit of the element in the array represents whether the node is handling that particular hash. If the key belongs to the node, then it will continue with the operation, otherwise it will check the state array to find the correct slot information, and return the correct host and port for the caller to find the correct node instead.

When there is node insertion or deletion, the slot distribution will be updated accordingly: in addition case, some of the slot from the existing node will be reassigned to the new node; in deletion case, the slot that belongs to the removed node will be assigned to the rest of node evenly.
