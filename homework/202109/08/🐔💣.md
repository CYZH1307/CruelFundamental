# URL Shortening

The specially thing about the requirement is that the service must be able to retrieve the URL from the shortened result. Since the size of input space (all possible URLs) is definitely greater than the size of output space (short result), it is not possible to design an algorithm that can work with the two-way conversion, and we have to include some storage service to maintain the mapping.

One way to generate the short result is to have a id distribution cluster, which generates unique id (auto increment with some unique identifier) either on the fly or in advance, and whenever there is a shortening request, it fetches one id from the cluster, and maintain the mapping in the cache storage with some expiration time. As long as the record expires before the id generation cluster runs out of the variation of the possible result, the service guarantees the uniqueness and the reversible mapping.
