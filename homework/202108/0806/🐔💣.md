# Blocking/Non-Blocking Channel

A channel (something similar to the queue asked in the origin question) has a blocking behaviour by default, which means if the no one reads from the channel, then the goroutine who writes to the channel will blocks, and vice versa:
```go
ch := make (chan int)

go func() {
  ch <- 1 // blocked
}
```

```go
ch := make (chan int)

go func() {
  v := <-ch // blocked
}
```

```go
ch := make (chan int)

go func() {
  ch <- 1 // ok
}

go func() {
  v := <-ch // ok
}
```

A buffered channel allows the channel to have some value stored in the buffer so the goroutine can send the data to the channel even without receiver. If the buffer is full then the channel will be blocked as well:
```go
ch := make (chan int, 1)

go func() {
  ch <- 1 // ok
  ch <- 1 // blocked
}
```

A non blocking channel can be implemented using `select` with `default`, if the channel cannot take any more elements, instead of blocking the goroutine, the default clause will be executed:
```go
ch := make (chan int)

go func() {
  select { 
  case ch <- 1:
    fmt.Println("ok") // not executed
  default:
    fmt.Println("not blocked") // will be executed
  }
}
```
