# MVCC 1/4

## Distributed transaction
- finite sequence of operations
- atomicity: the whole set of operations should all be committed or all be discarded
- consistency: objective invariants are maintained before and after the transaction
- isolation: transactions should not intervene each other
- durability: the data store should be persistent

## Problems
- dirty read: one transaction reads the uncommitted data (which may be in intermediate state)
- non repeatable: within the same transaction, the data read multiple times are inconsistent
- phantom read: the read result gets changed before the current transaction is committed

## Isolation levels
- read uncommitted: only prevent concurrent write to the same object, doesn't solve any of the problems above
- read committed: as the name suggests, all the data read by one transaction should be the committed version of other transactions, this solves dirty read
- repeatable read: data read by one transaction should not be modified by others, this solves non repeatable problem as well as dirty read
- serializable: all the transactions are executed in sequence, which solves all the problems
- locking can be used to offer the isolation levels, but this will incur performance overhead
