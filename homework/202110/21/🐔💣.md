# Microservices

## Advantages
- Independent development and deployment process, less intervention among teams, faster deployment flow
- Flexible scaling, customized container resource set up for different types of service (CPU bound or memory bound)
- Standalone service with different tech stacks that is most suitable for the tasks
- Less communication cost if the services are grouped in accordance to the organization structure

## Disadvantages
- Higher complexity from the challenges of distributed systems
- Performance impact from RPC network overhead
- Introduce additional development effort for service governance
- Harder to perform integrate testing and troubleshooting
- May incur resource wastage if redundancy is ensured for each of the microservices
