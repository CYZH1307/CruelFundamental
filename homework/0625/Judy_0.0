HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol for data exchange on the Web between client and server.

default port is TCP80, specifies how client construct request data and sends to server, and how server response to these requests.
Three components: client, proxy, server
client: application who sends request
proxy: can be gateway or cache, e.g., routers and moderns; used for filter, cache, load balance, authentication, log
server: can be a group of machine who can even share one IP, responds to client requests

Before a client and server can exchange an HTTP request/response pair, they must establish a TCP connection
HTTP/1.0 is to open a separate TCP connection for each HTTP request/response pair.
HTTP/1.1 introduced pipelining and persistent connections
HTTP/2 multiplex messages over a single connection

HTTP flow
1. open TCP connection
2. send an HTTP message
3. Read the response sent by the server
4. Close or reuse the connection for further requests
