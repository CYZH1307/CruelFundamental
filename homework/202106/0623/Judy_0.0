TCP 3-Way Handshake Process

Definition: Transimission Control Protocol - a protocol used in TCP/IP network to control the transmission of the data in a reliable way between client and server.
  It is prior to the real data communication process starts.
  
Steps
client(SYN = 1234) -> server
clinet <- server(ACK-SYN ACK = 1235, SYN = 7788)
client(ACK = 7789) ->server
...
FIN

1. client establishes a connection with a server. It sends a segment with SYN packet and informs the server about the client should start communication.
  The package contains a random sequence number(e.g., 1234) that indicates the beginning of the sequence numbers for data that client should transfer.
2. server acknownledges the client request by responding with SYN-ACK signal set. 
  a. ACK signifies the segment in step 1 is received (e.g. 1234 + 1 = 1235)
  b. SYN signifies what sequence num(e.g., 7788) it should start with the segments.
3. client acknowledges(ACK sequence num = 7788 + 1 = 7799) the response of the server, and they both create a stable connection will begin the actual data transfer process.
...
After the data transmission process is over, TCP automatically terminates the connection between client and server.
