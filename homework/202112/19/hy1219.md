# How is Virtual Memory Translated to Physical Memory

key words: **page table**, **MMU**, **TLB**

the translation is implemented by using **page tables** , which are managed by a **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** . All the physical memory refereces are passed through the MMU.

The MMU works together with the **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)** to map the virtual memory address to the physical memory address. Because page table always resides in memory, and having to look up the memory pages directly in physical memory, TLB works as a cache in CPU to improve speed.

In essence the TLB stores the recent translation from virtual to physical.
