There are 4 characteristics of object oriented programming language:
1. Encapsulation: the characteristics of object are encapsulated within class with public field and private field.
2. Abstraction: Functions who use object can use public (possibly protected) functions without needing to know details and implementations of function.
3. Polymorphism: run-time polymorphism: figure out which function to invoke at run time, used in method overriding
                 compile-time polymorphism: figure out which function to invoke at compile time, used in method overloading
4. Inheritance: subclass inherited from super class will inherit all public and protected fields and can override those inherited function depending on subclass' requirement.
