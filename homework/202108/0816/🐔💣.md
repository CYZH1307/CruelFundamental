# Distributed Lock in Redis

The purpose of distributed lock is to prevent race condition between distributed processes that are not able to be synchronized via in-process lock.

A very simple Redis-based implementation will be the `SETNX` command, this command will only succeed if the key doesn't exist, due to the single-threaded behaviour from Redis, only one process can successfully set the value which means it acquires the lock.

However, in order to prevent dead lock, the distributed lock should come with a timeout, if the timeout is reached, the lock will be automatically released (most likely this is due to the process that acquires the lock gets crashed). If we use `SETNX`, we also need to execute an `Expire` command to set the expiry for the key. Since these two operations are done separately, the lock acquisition is not atomic.

One way to resolve this is to use lua script, but in Redis 2.6.12, we can specify expiration time together with a `SET ... NX` command, which makes the flow atomic.

To release the lock, one can delete the value for that key, however, the value should be unique so it's ensured that the lock is indeed released by the same process that acquires it. The check and delete operation needs to be atomic so again we may need lua script here.
