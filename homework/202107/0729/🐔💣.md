- "Persistent Distributed Logs"
- **Database** stores "things" with different states.
- **Event** is the indication of what happens in time to the things in business.
- **Log** stores sequence of events.
- **Kafka** stores a collection of events in **topics**, with disk storage and replication.
- Topics can stay for any time and can be in small or large size.
- Instead of having a monolithic giant service, it's more popular to build services in a smaller scale that each of them can evolve independently and communicate with each other with event messages. The events are produced and consumed with the topics as the storage and communication medium.
- Kafka helps each services to be connected and provide api to group, filter and aggregate the messages by some characteristics.
