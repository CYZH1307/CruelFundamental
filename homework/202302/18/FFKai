## How are the five common Redis data types implemented?

1. Strings: Redis strings are simply sequences of bytes. They can be used to store any type of data, including integers, floating-point numbers, and binary data.
Redis stores strings using a simple **key-value** data structure, where the key is a string and the value is a string.

2. Hashes: Redis hashes are used to store key-value pairs where the key is a string and the value is also a string. Hashes are similar to dictionaries in other programming languages.
Redis stores hashes using a **hash table** data structure, where the key is hashed to an index in an array, and the value is stored at that index.

3. Lists: Redis lists are implemented as **doubly-linked lists**. Each node in the list stores a value, and pointers to the next and previous nodes. Redis provides commands to push and pop items from the beginning or end of the list, as well as to insert or remove items at arbitrary positions in the list.

4. Sets: Redis sets are implemented as **hash tables** where the value of each key is a simple binary value (1 or 0). 
Redis provides commands to add or remove items from a set, as well as to perform set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

5. Sorted Sets: Redis sorted sets are implemented as **a combination of a hash table and a skip list**. 
The hash table is used to store the values and their associated scores (which are used to determine the order of the elements in the set), while the skip list is used to maintain the sorted order of the elements. Redis provides commands to add or remove items from a sorted set, as well as to query the set based on score ranges or element rank.
