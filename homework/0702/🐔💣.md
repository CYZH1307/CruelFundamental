# String Memory Management

Essentially, a `string` in Go is just a immutable slice of bytes, but the element of the slice cannot be modified. Usually if we want to keep manipulating the content of the string, we define a `[]byte` explicitly instead, after the data are fixed, we can convert it back to a string.

To convert a byte slice to a string without memory copying can be do through

```go
s := *(*string)(unsafe.Pointer(b))
```

Due to the immutability of `string`, if we are doing naive string concatenation, like

```go
var s string

for i := 0; i < 100000; i++ {
	s += "a"
}
```

a new string/slice will be created so this brings a lot of memory copying and make the performance worse.

## `strings.Builder`

In Go 1.10, `strings.Builder` was introduced for a more efficient way to build string. The usage is as simple as

```go
var sb strings.Builder
for i := 0; i < 100000; i++ {
	sb.WriteString("a")
}
s = sb.String()
```

This is almost identical to maintaining the byte slice and perform manipulation on the slice directly, then convert the final result back to a string. Since `append` incurs less memory copying, it's more efficient than the raw concatenation.

`strings.Builder` also allows the user to grow the slice to the known size, which further reduce the memory allocation cost.

A simple benchmark can tell the difference

```go
package main

import (
	"strings"
	"testing"
)

const size = 10000

func BenchmarkConcat(b *testing.B) {
	for n := 0; n < b.N; n++ {
		var s string
		for i := 0; i < size; i++ {
			s += "a"
		}
	}
}

func BenchmarkStringsBuilder(b *testing.B) {
	for n := 0; n < b.N; n++ {
		var sb strings.Builder
		for i := 0; i < size; i++ {
			sb.WriteByte('a')
		}
		_ = sb.String()
	}
}

func BenchmarkStringsBuilderPreGrow(b *testing.B) {
	for n := 0; n < b.N; n++ {
		var sb strings.Builder
		sb.Grow(size)
		for i := 0; i < size; i++ {
			sb.WriteByte('a')
		}
		_ = sb.String()
	}
}
```
