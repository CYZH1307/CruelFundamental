# I/O Multiplexing

> I/O multiplexing is a mechanism through which a process can monitor multiple descriptors. Once a descriptor is ready (usually read or write), the program can be notified to perform corresponding read and write operations.

## Select

```c
int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout);
```

**advantages:**

- portable, currently supported on almost all platforms

**disadvanatge:** 

- max number of fds that can be monitered (generally $32*32=1024$ on Linux)
- $O(n)$ to traverse all the fds
- all fds need to be copied to kernel space each time select is called

## Poll

```c
int poll (struct pollfd *fds, unsigned int nfds, int timeout);

struct pollfd {
    int fd; /* file descriptor */
    short events; /* requested events to watch */
    short revents; /* returned events witnessed */
};
```

**advantages:**

- use `pollfd` instead of `fd_set`, solve 1024 limitaion
- $O(k)$ to traverse, where k is the number of fds to be moniteded, which is a improvement from $O(n)$

**disadvantages:**

- still need to copy descriptor arrays into kernel space
- performance decrases linearly as the monitered set increases, not suitable for large concurrent scenarios

## Epoll

```c
int epoll_create(int size)；//Create an epoll handle, size is used to tell the kernel how large the total number of monitors is
int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, struct epoll_event *event)；
int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event * events, int maxevents, int timeout);
```

**advantages:**

- each fd will only be copied into kernal once.
- does not add current to the device waiting queue corresponding to fd in turn every time like select or poll, but only hang current during epoll_ctl (this time is essential) and Specify a callback function for each fd
- don't limited by 1024
