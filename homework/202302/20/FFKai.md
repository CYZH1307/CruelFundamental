### Redis 如何实现数据不丢失？How does Redis ensure data persistence?

Redis provides two ways to ensure data persistence: snapshots and append-only files.

Snapshots: Redis can periodically write a snapshot of the in-memory data to disk as a binary file. The snapshot contains a complete copy of the data at a specific point in time. The snapshot is created by forking the Redis process and writing the data to a file. The forked process continues to serve read requests while the main process continues to write data to the snapshot file. Once the snapshot is complete, Redis replaces the existing snapshot file with the new one. In the event of a system failure, Redis can use the most recent snapshot file to restore the data.

Append-only files: Redis can write all write operations to a log file called an append-only file (AOF). Redis writes the commands to the file in the order they were executed. This ensures that the data can be reconstructed by playing back the log file. When Redis restarts, it reads the append-only file and applies the commands to rebuild the in-memory data. This approach provides a higher level of data persistence because it records each write operation.

By default, Redis uses snapshots to persist data. However, it is possible to enable AOF persistence as well. The choice of which method to use depends on the specific use case and the desired trade-offs between performance and data persistence.
