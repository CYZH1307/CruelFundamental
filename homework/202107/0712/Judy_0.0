Linux TCP

TCP: protocol, how connection between two systems is established and maintained 
    how a message is broken down to be transmitted, and reassemble in a right order in the destination
IP: protocol, how two systems send package of data to each other, address and route package for delivery
    each computer on the network checks the IP to determine where to forward the message
CLOSE_WAIT: a state of TCP connection
  The remote end has shut down, waiting for the socket to close.
	compare to TTIME_WAIT: local endpoint has closed the connection
 
Steps to terminate TCP connection between host A and B:
	1. Fin Wait: A sends FIN packet and waits for respose, release some resources and wait for response
	2. Close Wait: B release resources and wait for closing application layer
	3. Last Ack Wait: B sends FIN to A and wait for ack
	4. Time Wait: A can fully close its job and waits for network collision, sends the final ack
	5. B receives final ack and kills the connection
