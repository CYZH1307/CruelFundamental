# Orphan Process and Zombie Process

If a parent process is terminated, then its child processes becomes orphan process. If this happens, re-parenting will happen which marks the `init` process (that has pid=1) as the parent of the orphan processes. Usually orphan process is undesired and operating system will usually protect this from happening. For example, it will send `SIGHUP` to the child processes if their parent process is crashed unexpectedly.

If a child process exits, but the parent process does not call `wait` to receive the exit code, the entry of the child process will persist in the process table, which might take up the resources. Usually killing the parent process will resolve this since the zombie processes will become orphan processes and later adopted by the `init`.
