##### HTTPS Process

- Client side will initiate the TLS handshake, passing extra information like client random, TLS version and cupported cipher cuites.
- Server generates server random, pick one of the cipher suite, and most importantly, the certificate.
- Client queries certificate authority to authenticate the certificate and verify the identity of the server.
- In order to established the secure communication, a shared key for the symmetric encryption has to be exchanged, depending on the implementation, this chould be achieved in two ways:
	- **RSA**: client encrypts a random key using the pubic key from the server in the previous response, and server decrypts it using its own private key. Shared key can be then generated using this value together with the previous client and server randoms.
	- **Diffie-Hellman**: client and server generates the values using their own secrets, and exchange the generated value. After that, both of the parties combine the keys from each other and their own secrets, generating a common key that no one else can forge even if the generated value was compromised before.
- Client and server exchanges the message using the generated key, and the handshake is completed
