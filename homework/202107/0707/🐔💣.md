# Clustered Index vs. Non-Clustered Index

Clustered index is the index that defines the physical order of rows in the database storage. A table can have at most 1 clustered index since the rows are only stored for one copy.

On the other hand, non-clustered index needs extra storage which contains only the columns in the index as well as the address of the actual row. Multiple non-clustered indices could be created but it brings the overhead of disk usage as well as worse performance on write operations.

When a lookup operation is triggered and it hits a clustered index, the database engine traverses on the B+ tree and reach the record of the row data and return straightaway. However, when the lookup happens on a non-clustered index, after the traversal, it still need to perform another disk IO to fetch the real data from the address. If the lookup is a range query, the difference will be more obvious.

Writing to a table with clustered index can be less efficient because it requires disk shuffle to rearrange the order, if a table only contains non-clustered index then this shuffle cost will be less.
