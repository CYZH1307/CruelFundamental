# TCP Termination and TIME_WAIT

## Termination Process

Due to the full-duplex nature of a TCP connection, the termination of a connection needs both of the communicating parties to `close` the connection. Hence four-way handshake is required here:

- Sender initiates the termination by passing FIN to the receiver, the state is transferred to FIN_WAIT_1.
- Receiver receives and acknowledges the FIN, the state is now CLOSE_WAIT, when sender receives this ACK, its state is moved to FIN_WAIT_2.
- Receiver sends the FIN to the sender, the state is LAST_ACK now.
- Sender receives the FIN, replying an ACK, and stay in TIME_WAIT for sufficiently long time, then move to CLOSED.
- Whenever receiver receives the ACK, it will be CLOSED immediately.

## TIME_WAIT

The TIME_WAIT state is to ensure the connection is fully processed and the other party indeed receives the ACK (otherwise the FIN may be resent). However if the server is the active party that terminates the connection, there might be a lot of TCP connection getting stuck in the TIME_WAIT state which will take the resource because a server's TCP port is limited.

In Linux, we can use `netstat` command to view the status of current TCP connection. Usually the flag `-anp` is passed:

- `-a`: show the state of all socket with default display.
- `-n`: show the address as number instead of alias.
- `-p`: show process information.

We can use `grep` to filter the state like

```
netstat -anp | grep TIME_WAIT
```
