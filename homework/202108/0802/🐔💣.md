# Reentrant Lock

With normal mutex, if a function is recursively acquiring the lock that's held by itself, it will run into a deadlock:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var mu sync.Mutex

func f(i int) {
	fmt.Println(i)
	if i == 0 {
		return
	}
	mu.Lock()
	f(i - 1)
	mu.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	f(5)
}
```

```

```

The reason behind this is that the current goroutine is holding the lock but when it recursively call itself, it tries to acquire the same lock that's pending release from the same goroutine, deadline happens.

Reentrant lock is a special lock that resolve this, a typical implementation usually involves different lock acquisition operation: if the thread that acquires the lock already holds the lock, then it increment some counter to make sure the lock will be available only after it's released for the same number of time; otherwise, it will block there waiting for the lock to be released by others who currently hold it.

Reentrant lock is considered "just a mistake, nothing more than a comfortable home for bugs" [by Russ Cox](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/XqW1qcuZgKg/m/Ui3nQkeLV80J?pli=1) and it's not implemented in Golang. According to Russ, mutex is to ensure some invariants but reentrant lock may break the invariant if the current goroutine doesn't know if the same lock will be acquired again in another function, and there is always a better way (like having multiple grouting and using a channel to coordinate them) to reimplement the logic instead of introducing a reentrant lock.
