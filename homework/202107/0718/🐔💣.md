# Limit of Redis Set

The question is asking us whether there is any limit on the size of a Redis set, and the answer is yes.

According to the official document of Redis, the max number of elements in a set is 2 to the power of 32 minus 1 (2^32-1) which is 4294967295. In other words, for each set, there could be up to 4 billion and 294 million unique values there in the set, which should be large enough to hold the elements of a certain set.

There are some discussion going on under Redis' GitHub repository (https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/757) to discuss if the limit should be removed; however, due to some performance consideration, the limitation is still valid there for now.
