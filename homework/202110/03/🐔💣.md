# Index for Deletion

Database index is an efficient structure for faster positioning when finding some elements with the criteria that can be covered by the indices. Technically, since deletion will use the where clause which is indeed a search on the existing record, it will benefit from the index.

However, it's commonly seen in some of the blog post saying that the index doesn't work for deletion, quite often it happens when the where clause contains an `in` statement, changing that to a inner join that the deletion statement has a direct handle on the record rows would solve the issue.

Index hints can be used to explicitly tell the optimizer which index to use, it resolve some problem where the index could be used but not used by the query optimizer, however this can only be used together with select and update statements, but not delete statements.
