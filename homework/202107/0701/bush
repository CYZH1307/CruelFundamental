Threads and Process.
1. Concept
Process is a running program, it has at least one thread for execution and is the minimum unit when allocate resources. 
Thread is part of the process, it's the minimum unit that can be scheduled to execute.
2. Relationship
One process could have at least one thread.
Thread can only use its process's resources, it can't apply new resources.
3. Resource Sharing
Processes don't share resources.
Threads within one process could share some resources(like memory) and resource competetion could be happened.
4. Communication
Communication between threads within a single process could be quite quick.
But cross-process-comunication would have a heavy cost.

Which have a better performance?
Thread.
It is much more lightweight than process and has smaller cost for creation and context switching.
Even for one process which has only one thread, it should first apply for resources and then begin to schedule the thread to be executed.
