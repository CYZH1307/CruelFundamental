# Primary Key in MySQL

As discussed in [Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Index](https://github.com/refinedcoding/CruelFundamental/blob/main/homework/0707/%F0%9F%90%94%F0%9F%92%A3.md), (for InnoDB engine), if a non-clustered index is used for lookup, there will be two traversals: one to find the primary key/clustered index from the non-clustered index, then find the row record from the primary key.

If the value of the primary key is too large, it will increase the size of secondery indices' storage, which leads to a higher chance of disk IO that may potentially degenerate the performance of the database queries.

A common approach to resolve this issue is to introduce another shorter id as the primary key, for example, an auto increment integer id.
