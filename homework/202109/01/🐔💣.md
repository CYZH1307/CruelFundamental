# SQL vs NoSQL

## SQL
- Store data in tables with predefined schema, hard to extend
- Clear relationship between record
- Support transaction, good for data consistency and distributed operations
- Relying on joining for data retrieval
- Use cases: complicated models with well-defined relationships and structure or requiring transactional support

## NoSQL
- Flexible, schemaless, various representation
- Extensible, suitable for systems with ever-changing requirements
- Good data retrieval performance without table joins
- Use cases: fast growing prototype, or services with search performance requirement.
- Since NoSQL is flexible in terms of the data representation (document-based, row-based, simple KV storage, search oriented), we can further choose specific type of NoSQL storage to best suit our needs.
