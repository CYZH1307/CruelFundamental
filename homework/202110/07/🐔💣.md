# Facebook Outage

Reference: https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details

The backbone network which connects the internal datacenter with the global internet was taken down during the maintenance by mistake, and due some bugs in their audit system, it doesn't prevent this from happening (which should be so if the bug doesn't exist).

By design, the DNS server will disable the BGP advertisement when the datacenter is not accessible because of potential risk from the DNS itself under this circumstances, once this happens, the DNS without fresh cache will fail to determine what's the server IP address from the datacenter, thus the user won't be able to access the Facebook service through the domain name if they are querying the DNS server that gets affected.

The reason why it takes so long to get recovered is from the security concern, since they had applied many access protocol to deliberately make it hard to alter the configuration on the physical server, which took more time for the engineer to get things recovered.
