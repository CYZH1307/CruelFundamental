# CLOSE_WAIT

Usually when the other side of the TCP connection initiates a FIN, the receiver will transits into the CLOSE_WAIT state, waiting for the application that hold the connection to close the socket. If the application side encounter some issue like logical bug or full CPU usage, then the close event may not happen which causes many TCP connection stuck in the CLOSE_WAIT state, once the connection exceeds the maximum number of file descriptors then no new connection can be received.

The solution is also mainly on the application side, it must ensure the connection is closed properly after the communication. Alternatively, timeout mechanism can be adopted to close the connection that has been idle for some amount of time.
