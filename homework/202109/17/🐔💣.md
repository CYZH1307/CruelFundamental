# RedLock

- Distributed lock is useful to support mutual exclusive access to shared resources.
- Previously in one of the homework, it was mentioned that we can use `SETNX` to implement distributed lock with one key, however race condition may happens when the master node is crashed since replication is asynchronous and the state could be inconsistent.
- For a single instance Redis, implementing distributed lock needs to use a randomly generated signature as the value and only remove the key when the value is the same as the value generated. This is to avoid releasing a lock that was acquired by others after the client's lock expires.
- For distributed case, the RedLock algorithm has the following step
  - the clients tries to acquire the lock from multiple masters one by one, and the operation timeout should be relatively smaller compare to the expiration.
  - the clients successfully acquire the lock only when it gets positive response from majority of the masters, and the total time elapsed is shorter than the lock expiration time.
  - if the clients fails the above step, it will release the lock from all the masters.
