MySQL index

InnoDB 
  a general-purpose storage engine that balances high reliability and high performance. 
  In MySQL 8.0, InnoDB is the default MySQL storage engine
  
Clustered and Secondary Indexes
  one tabel has one clustered index
  When you define a PRIMARY KEY on a table, InnoDB uses it as the clustered index
  With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index.
  With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows
  one table can have multiple non clustered indexes, although each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records.
  
Spatial indexes use R-trees, which are specialized data structures for indexing multi-dimensional data.
other InnoDB indexes are B-tree data structures. 
Index records are stored in the leaf pages of their B-tree or R-tree data structure.
