Overload vs. Override

Overload
  When two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters
  Compile polymorphism
  An overloaded method may or may not have different return types. But return type alone is not sufficient for the compiler to determine which method is to be executed at run time.  
  
Override
  When the method signature (name and parameters) are the same in the superclass and the child class
  Runtime Polymorphism
