In early java version(before java8), HashMap is implemented by array and list.
But as it would cost a lot when there are a lot of collisions, which would make the list very long and take lots of time for query.
In java8, redblack tree is imported to instead the list when the data size is big or there are lots of collisions.
It's a balanced binary search tree and reduce the worst query time complexity from O(n) to O(log(n)).
