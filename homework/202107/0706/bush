Index in MySQL
Index is a support to spped up query performance in database.
There are some data structures used to build Index.
1. Binary Search Tree
It takes O(logn) time for query in average.
But in database like MySQL, we always have some auto increament field.
This could lead to build a list and make timecomplexity O(n).
2. Red-black Tree/AVL Tree
Based on the disadvantage above, we use a balanced Binary Search Tree to cut down the worst time complexity.
3. B Tree
The balanced binary tree implement is good.
But with B tree, we could lower the height of the whole tree, which could help to make query faster.
4. B+ Tree
B Tree saves data in its interval nodes, but B+ Tree only saves data in its leaves node. Its interval nodes only save the data's reference.
This feature makes B+ Tree saving more info compre to B Tree.
Further more, B+ Tree's leaves are connected, which could benifit range query.

And actually, MySQL chossed B+ Tree to build its Index.
