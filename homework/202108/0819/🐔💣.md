# TCP Congestion Control

Congestion is a common problem when the network bandwidth is limited and the incoming traffic (usually from the sender's local area network) comes faster than the rate of outgoing traffic. The congestion condition will increase the network delay and even cause packet loss and eventually affect the quality of service.

TCP uses a congestion window to control the rate of sender traffic. Originally the window size is relatively small, and this is called "slow start". When the packets within the current congestion window are transmitted successfully, the window size will increase. It might be increasing exponentially in the beginning, but after the threshold, the speed of increasing will be slower.

When network congestion happens (detected via packet timeout), the congestion window will shrink to some smaller value or even to the original value, the threshold will also be reduced, so it won't grow that aggressively next round. Since the traffic will start over again with the slow pace, the congestion situation should be gradually recovered.

There are various ways of implementing this congestion control algorithm but generally they follow the similar idea.

On top of the general congestion window idea, fast retransmit is also a commonly discussed topic to reduce the time that the sender needs to wait until it retransmits a loss packet.
