## What is kernel mode and user mode

- **Kernel Mode:** the privileged mode where the process has unrestricted access to system resources like hardware, memory, etc. 
- **User Mode:** normal mode where the process has limited access.

## How to switch between kernel mode and user mode

The kernel provides System Call Interface (**SCI**), which are the entry points for kernel. System Calls are the only way through which a process can go into kernel mode from user mode.
