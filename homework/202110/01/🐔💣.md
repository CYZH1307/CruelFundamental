# Consistency in Distributed Systems

- Consistency ensures the distributed nodes reach agreement on some condition.
- Strong consistency requires the consistency is met at any point of the time, but eventual consistency can tolerate intermediate state as long as the consistency can be achieved in the indefinite future.
- Synchronization between nodes that connected via network is hard, because network itself is unreliable, packet loss or data corruption may cause the synchronization failures.
- Distributed nodes might not be alive all the time, it's possible that some nodes in the system dies (or revives) so the entity of the consistency may keep changing.
- The corruption itself can even happen in a inconsistent way, which leads to Byzantine faults.
