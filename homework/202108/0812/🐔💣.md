# Go Memory Allocation

- Stack and heap are the two main sections in the virtual memory
- Allocation will manage the memory allocation for mutator's usage, collector will recycle the unused memory on heap

## Bump Allocator
- Simple implementation, maintain a pointer for the free and allocated sections
- Once the allocated memory get garbage collected, it creates "holes" in the allocated sections which reduce the use rate of the heap memory
- Need to constantly rearrange the memory so the fragments are collected and merged for future allocation

## Free List Allocator
- Use linked list to maintain the free memory
- Iterate through the available "node" and find the one that's big enough to hold the object
- Less performant as iteration is needed
- Different strategies exist for different purpose

## Caching
- Objects are categorized based on the size, and store them in thread cache, central cache and page heap from small to large
- Thread cache is per thread, so no synchronization issue with multi threading, which brings good performance

## Linea Mapping
- Reserved heap memory
- `spans`: 512MB, storing the MMU pointers
- `bitmap`: 16GB, storing the "flags" for whether each of the segment in the arena is filled with data
- `arena`: 512GB, the real storage split into multiple 8kb pages
- Memory address may collide when Go program is running with C code

## Sparse Mapping
- `heapArena` maintains pointer to each page on the virtual memory
