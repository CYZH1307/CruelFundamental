Logic:
MD5 Algorithm + Base 64 Encoding: 
If we use the MD5 algorithm as our hash function, it will produce a 128-bit hash value. After base64 encoding, weâ€™ll get a string having more than 21 characters (since each base64 character encodes 6 bits of the hash value). Now we only have space for 6 (or 8) characters per short key; how will we choose our key then? We can take the first 6 (or 8) letters for the key. This could result in key duplication; to resolve that, we can choose some other characters out of the encoding string or swap some characters.
