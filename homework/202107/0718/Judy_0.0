Redis storage limits

String, List, Set, Hash, Sorted Set
  upto  2^32 - 1 elements (4294967295, > 4 billion)
  each element can be at max 512 MB
  sorted set takes more memory than set
  hashes, sets, lists are designed to be encoded in a much more efficient fashion when they are composed of a few elements
  use hash when possible, e.g., user with name(key1), email(key2), address(key3) -> single hash will all three fields
  compile with 32bit target < 64bit
