按数据结构分类可分为：B+tree索引、Hash索引、Full-text索引。
按物理存储分类可分为：聚簇索引、二级索引（辅助索引）。
按字段特性分类可分为：主键索引、普通索引、前缀索引。
按字段个数分类可分为：单列索引、联合索引（复合索引、组合索引）。

Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly. Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first row and then read through the entire table to find the relevant rows. The larger the table, the more this costs. If the table has an index for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly determine the position to seek to in the middle of the data file without having to look at all the data. This is much faster than reading every row sequentially.

Most MySQL indexes (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, INDEX, and FULLTEXT) are stored in B-trees. Exceptions: Indexes on spatial data types use R-trees; MEMORY tables also support hash indexes; InnoDB uses inverted lists for FULLTEXT indexes.

In general, indexes are used as described in the following discussion. Characteristics specific to hash indexes (as used in MEMORY tables) are described in Section 8.3.9, “Comparison of B-Tree and Hash Indexes”.

MySQL uses indexes for these operations:

- To find the rows matching a WHERE clause quickly.
- To eliminate rows from consideration. If there is a choice between multiple indexes, MySQL normally uses the index that finds the smallest number of rows (the most selective index). 
- If the table has a multiple-column index, any leftmost prefix of the index can be used by the optimizer to look up rows. For example, if you have a three-column index on (col1, col2, col3), you have indexed search capabilities on (col1), (col1, col2), and (col1, col2, col3). For more information, see Section 8.3.6, “Multiple-Column Indexes”.
