# Transaction Isolation Levels

## Problem
- Dirty read: an uncommitted (possibly rolled back later) change is read by another transaction.
- Non-repeatable read: in one transaction, different results are read from the same record.
- Phantom read: in one transaction, different results are read from the same search query.

## Isolation levels

## Read uncommitted
- Basically no isolation.
- Good performance because of no lock is introduced.
- All the transaction problems might happen.

## Read committed
- Only the committed data will be read by others.
- Only solve the dirty read problem.

## Repeatable read
- The changes from other transaction will only be visible after the current transaction is committed.
- Within the same transaction, the data read is always consistent (repeatable).
- MVCC is used so a transaction will only read the data from one particular snapshot.

## Serializable
- Lock is used to ensure that write operation doesn't happen together with other operation (either read or write) for the same record.
- Strongest isolation level that solves all three problems but also least performant.
