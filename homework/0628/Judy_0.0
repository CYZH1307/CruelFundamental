HashMap in C#

C# doesn't have HashMap but the closest one is Dictionary, which is similar as Map in Java
to get the value by key: myDictionary[key] = value

null key:
  java allow null key, while c# throws ArgumentNullException
  
duplicate:
  java replaces with new one
  c# replaces with new one when use [], but throw ArgumentException when use Add method

non-existing:
  Java returns null
  C# throws KeyNotFoundException, can use TryGetValue or ContainsKey to check
  
behind the HashMap in java
  1. get the hash code of key
  2. imagine there are n(16) bucket for the map, hashcode & n to find the bucket to put the value
  3. in the bucket, there is a node(linked list), node has key, value, hashcode, and next pointer
