# Sharding

As the business grows and the request load increases, it's very necessary to perform sharding for the database and table to ensure the scalability.

In e-commerce whole, there are different strategies to apply. For example, the database can be separated based on the functionalities, so different logical groups will have their own database rather than stuffing all the information into one which could bring the issue with loads or connection counts. A common example is to break the order flow into different process and set up different database or tables for the individual stage. Also, if for a single business, if the load is still too much, horizontal sharding can be applied which is trying to shard the table into multiple tables, each of them can be in charge of a certain set of records identified by the hash, in this case, the incoming traffic will be scattered into different table so the loads can be reduce.

Of course, setting up master-slave clusters can also resolve the problem but it's not in the scope of discussion
