# Message Deduplication

Message may be duplicated from either side:
- the same message is published twice from the producer
- the same message is consumed twice form the consumer
The root cause may be unstable network that makes the acknowledgement dropped so the events are basically "retried".

To avoid this duplication, a unique key could be generated and attached to each event, and both producer and consumer can rely on any distributed consistent state storage or even the database constraint to ensure the unique execution of a certain event. This resembles the concept in TCP that adding additional checks to preserve some invariants under the unreliable medium.
