# MySQL Master-Slave Replication

In a single node set up, both the read and write operation will be handler by the master node, it increases the load to the master and if the write operation requires some exclusive lock, it may affect the read performance as well.

A common approach is to create several replications that asynchrounously synchronize the data from the master database, and provide read services. In this case, it provides higher availability for the read operation and increase the overall throughput of the whole system. This could be particularly useful in the situation where the read operations are significantly larger than the write operations.

There are a few ways to synchronize the data from master to slaves, most of them are related to the binlog replication. When master finish the write operation, it record the changes in the binlog, and when the slaves need to update the latest data, they request the master to dump the copy of binlog and upon receving the full data, they store them in the relay log which will be used to perform the corresponding operations to update the database content.
