# Consistency Hashing

If we build hash with naive modulo approach, when the number of nodes is changed (either increased or decreased), rehash is required for every single value stored in the whole cluster. This rehash process can be inefficient since the value needs to relocated in another node.

Consistent hash solves the problem by putting the hash value (without modulo) on a ring, and assign each of the storage node a virtual value on the ring. When we make decision on which node should store a particular value, instead of taking the mod of the hash value, we find the nearest node to the clockwise direction on the ring, and assign the key there. In this case, if we are going to add or remove nodes, the relocation of keys only happens to a portion of the keys originally located between two nodes, so the affected keys are much less.
