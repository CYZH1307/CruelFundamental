# Redis Consistency

Due to the master-salve architecture and the asynchronous replication, Redis clusters does not provide strong consistency (i.e. it's possible to get the acknowledged write lost under some circumstances). The reason why Redis handles replication asynchronously is that the performance is the primary concern for an in-memory data storage, if the master waits for the acknowledgement from all the slaves then return the response, the latency will be increased and the performance will drop.

If synchronous replication is indeed needed, Redis also provides a `WAIT` command to wait for all the ongoing writes to be successfully stored in the slaves. This doesn't ensure the strong consistency because during the replication there could be many other issues happen in the distributed world like the cluster nodes are split and an reelection happens resulting in a outdated node becomes the new master etc. In practical terms, this `WAIT` command however improve the reliability of the data transfer and all the decisions are made as a result of tradeoff between performance and consistency.
