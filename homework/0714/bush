1. BIO: Blocking IO
When do IO operations, include reading and writing, the whole thread would blocks there until all tasks finished.
2. NIO: Non-blocking IO
It's based on event-driven design.
Thread is used to map the request to a multiplex selector.
Selector would do loop checking if there is a new IO request, and assign a thread to it if any request detected.
The assigned thread would keeping checking if the IO process is finished, and return the result.
Compared to BIO, use NIO could save more resource to handle coming requests.
3. AIO: Asynchronous Non-blocking IO
It's an upgrade of NIO.
The difference is the thread which handle IO processing would run in background, no others would be blocked by it.
When the IO operation is finished, it would call some callback method.
Compared to NIO, it saves cost of checking if the IO process is finished.
4. Why Redis is so quick
Redis is memory based and single threaded.
Memory based makes IO operation quick.
Single threaded saves cost of context switching.
It uses multiplex, which means the only IO thread would be applied for all coming requests.
