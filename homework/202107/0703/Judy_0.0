Dead lock
Deadlocks are a set of blocked processes each holding a resource and waiting to acquire a resource held by another process.

Necessary Conditions. The deadlock situation can only arise if all the following four conditions hold simultaneously:
  Mutual Exclusion - atleast one resource should be non-shareable
  Hold and wait - A process is holding atleast one resource and is waiting for additional resources.
  NO preemption - Resources cannot be taken from the process because resources can be released only voluntarily by the process holding them.
  Circular wait - the set of processes are waiting for each other in the circular form.
  
Methods For Handling Deadlocks
  Ignoring the Deadlock - used for  browsing and for normal tasks
  Deadlock Prevention - violate any one condition among the four
  Avoiding the Deadlock - used by the operating system in order to check whether the system is in a safe state or in an unsafe state
  Deadlock detection and recovery - preemption & roll back
