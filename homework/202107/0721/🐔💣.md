# Naive Mutex Implementation in Golang

Mutex is defined in the `sync` package, it contains two variable `state` and `sema`. `state` is used to represent two pieces of information: the number of sleeping goroutines and the current mutex status; and `sema` is the counting semaphore to coordinate the parked and woken goroutines.

To make this homework short, only the naive mode will be discussed, the spin lock and mutex fairness/starvation mode will be ignored.

## Struct Definition

```go
type Mutex struct {
  state int32
  sema  uint32
}
```

There are three flag bit in the state:
```go
const (
  // COMMENT: three flags
  mutexLocked = 1 << iota
  mutexWoken
  mutexStarving
  // COMMENT: shift count for storing the number in the higher bits
  mutexWaiterShift = iota
)
```
The higher 32-3=29 bits are used for the number of "waiters", so there is also a `mutexWaiterShift` defined.

## Locking

In the `Lock` method, there is a fast path for the lock acquisition for the unlocked mutex:
```go
func (m *Mutex) Lock() {
  // Fast path: grab unlocked mutex.
  if atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32(&m.state, 0, mutexLocked) {
    if race.Enabled {
      race.Acquire(unsafe.Pointer(m))
    }
    return
  }
  // ...
}
```
If the `state` is 0, it means this is a fresh mutex and no one has been holding the lock, it will just use CAS to mark it as locked and return. Otherwise, it will fall into the slow path:
```go
func (m *Mutex) Lock() {
  // ...
  // Slow path (outlined so that the fast path can be inlined)
  m.lockSlow()
}
```
In the slow path, each of the goroutine will has a `awoke` boolean state:
```go
func (m *Mutex) lockSlow() {
  var waitStartTime int64
  starving := false
  awoke := false // <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  iter := 0
  old := m.state
  // ...
}
```
There will be a infinite `for` loop for the locking procedure, it will firstly try to set the lock bit and increment the waiter count:
```go
func (m *Mutex) lockSlow() {
  // ...
  for {
    // ...skipping the spin lock logic
    new := old
    // Don't try to acquire starving mutex, new arriving goroutines must queue.
    if old&mutexStarving == 0 {
      // COMMENT: set the locked flag on for the new state
      new |= mutexLocked
    }
    // COMMENT: increment the waiter count
    if old&(mutexLocked|mutexStarving) != 0 {
      new += 1 << mutexWaiterShift
    }
    // ...skipping the starvation mode logic
    // ...
}
```
If the `awoke` is marked `true`, it means the goroutine has been woken from asleep, thus the woken bit needs to be cleared. Another CAS is performed here to ensure there is only one goroutine enter acquisition section. The goroutine will be parked by calling `runtime_SemacquireMutex` and waiting for waking when someone release the lock:
```go
func (m *Mutex) lockSlow() {
  // ...
  for {
    // ...
    if awoke {
      // The goroutine has been woken from sleep,
      // so we need to reset the flag in either case.
      if new&mutexWoken == 0 {
        throw("sync: inconsistent mutex state")
      }
      new &^= mutexWoken
    }
    // COMMENT: atomic CAS to update the state
    if atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32(&m.state, old, new) {
      // COMMENT: old value is not locked, meaning that this goroutine has successfully acquired the mutex (changing the locked flag from 0 to 1), break here as a success scenario
      if old&(mutexLocked|mutexStarving) == 0 {
        break // locked the mutex with CAS
      }
      // ...skipping faireness queue
      // COMMENT: P operation of a semaphore, park the goroutine and wait to be woken
      runtime_SemacquireMutex(&m.sema, queueLifo, 1)
      // ..skipping starvation mode
      // COMMENT: mark awoke as true since the gorotuine is woken through a semaphore release
      awoke = true
      iter = 0
    }
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Unlocking

Unlocking is like a reversed procedure of the lock function, it also has a fast path, if after the unlock no one is waiting for the lock (i.e. the state is back to the original zero value) return directly:
```go
func (m *Mutex) Unlock() {
  // ...
  // Fast path: drop lock bit.
  new := atomic.AddInt32(&m.state, -mutexLocked)
  if new != 0 {
    // Outlined slow path to allow inlining the fast path.
    // To hide unlockSlow during tracing we skip one extra frame when tracing GoUnblock.
    m.unlockSlow(new)
  }
}
```
Otherwise, `unlockSlow` will be invoked to wake up the waiting goroutine:
```go
func (m *Mutex) unlockSlow(new int32) {
  if (new+mutexLocked)&mutexLocked == 0 {
    throw("sync: unlock of unlocked mutex")
  }
  if new&mutexStarving == 0 {
    old := new
    for {
      // If there are no waiters or a goroutine has already
      // been woken or grabbed the lock, no need to wake anyone.
      // In starvation mode ownership is directly handed off from unlocking
      // goroutine to the next waiter. We are not part of this chain,
      // since we did not observe mutexStarving when we unlocked the mutex above.
      // So get off the way.
      if old>>mutexWaiterShift == 0 || old&(mutexLocked|mutexWoken|mutexStarving) != 0 {
        return
      }
      // Grab the right to wake someone.
      // COMMENT: decrement the waiter count and set the woken bit
      new = (old - 1<<mutexWaiterShift) | mutexWoken
      // COMMENT: atomic CAS to update the state
      if atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32(&m.state, old, new) {
        // COMMENT: V operation of the semaphore to increase the value and wake up the parked goroutine
        runtime_Semrelease(&m.sema, false, 1)
        return
      }
      // COMMENT: if someone has acquired the lock successfully after the locked flag is reset in Unlock function, the previous CAS will fail, setting old to be the current state and go for the next round of check
      // COMMENT: in the case that the lock is acquired already, it will return (see original comment before the return at the start of the for loop)
      old = m.state
    }
  } else {
    // ...skipping the starving ode
  }
}
```
