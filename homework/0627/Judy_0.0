Difference between B and B+ tree
used for multi level index for DB
B tree:
  nodes are sorted in the inorder traversal, with the lowest value on the left and the highest value on the right.
  a node can have more than two children
  self-balancing: the height is adjusted automatically at each update. leaves are on the same level, no empty sub tree above leaves
  
B+ tree
  sort data pointers only at leaves, data pointers only present at leaves
  the leaf nodes must store all the key values along with their corresponding data pointers to the disk file block
  leaf nodes are linked to providing ordered access to the records
  
Binary tree -> m way search tree(more than two children) - > B tree(has specific rule, buttom up) 
-> B+ tree(pointers are all on leaves, not on the node above leaves, and one leaf pointers the next leaf in order)
