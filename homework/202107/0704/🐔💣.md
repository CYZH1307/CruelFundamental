# Go Generics

Go doesn't have generics implemented in the latest version (1.16.5), however, [a proposal of generics](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md) was accepted and it's targeted to be released in 1.18.

In the proposal, type parameters can be passed to a function to make it generic, a constraint (possibly `any`, which means no constraint) can be applied to the type.

```go
// type parameter with no constraint
func f1[T any](p T) { ... }

// type parameter with predeclared constraint
func f2[T constraints.Comparable](p T) { ... }

// self defined constraint
type Chives interface {
  Daka(time.Time) 
}

func reap[T Chives](p []T) { ... }
```

The usage could be quite similar as interface in Go, but with generics, no type assertion/casting is needed, the value will be consumed and returned as its original type. It also helps us to write less code for similar function like min/max.

```go
// before
func minInt(a, b int) int {
  if a < b {
    return a
  }
  return b
}

func minInt32(a, b int32) int32 {
  if a < b {
    return a
  }
  return b
}

func minUint32(a, b uint32) uint32 {
  if a < b {
    return a
  }
  return b
}

func minFloat(a, b float) float {
  if a < b {
    return a
  }
  return b
}

// after
type Ordered interface {
	type int, int8, int16, int32, int64,
		uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr,
		float32, float64
}

func min[T Ordered](a, b T) T {
  if a < b {
    return a
  }
  return b
}
```
