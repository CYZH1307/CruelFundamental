# MVCC (2/4 ~ 4/4)

## Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
- Store different version of data in database
- Determine the version of data to use for a transaction
- Used in read committed and repeatable read
- Better performance than lock-based solution
- Each transaction has its own auto increment ID
- Reverse operation is recorded in undo log for data rollback with atomicity and consistency
- Roll pointer hidden column chain the different versions
- If read with explicit lock, will always read from the current version instead of the snapshot
- When statement is executed, read view will be created which determines which transaction's result is visible to the current transaction

## Analysis
- In Read Committed, if the modified data from another transaction is not committed, the transaction will appear in the `m_ids` list, so it's not visible
- Once it's committed, it gets removed from the `m_ids` then it's visible even before the reading transaction is committed
- In Repeatable Read, the read view will only be created once for a transaction, so the visible check will yield the same result, thus the read data is consistent
