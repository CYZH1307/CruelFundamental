# `mmap`

In short, `mmap` will construct the mapping between a section in virtual memory (usually between stack and heap) and the file content. When the content is being accessed, the page fault  will be triggered and the content will be loaded from the file into the memory. Once the content is modified, the mapped struct will write the changes back to the file, user can also call `msync` to force this update to happen immediately.

In normal file IO, the file content will be firstly loaded into the page cache before it get stored in the user space memory, when `mmap` is used, the file content will be directed mapped to the memory for manipulation. This makes the IO more effective and it also enables the communication between process since they can `mmap` the same file into their own virtual memory, and the modification can be synchronized between the processes.
