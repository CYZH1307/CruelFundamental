# CAP

CAP refers to Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance.

- Consistency means the whole distributed system should be linearizable, from the point of the user, the data should be consistent among multiple accesses with ongoing write requests, and the system, despite distributed, should behave like a single application.
- Availability is straightforward, which means the system should be serving the request successfully at any point of the time.
- Partition tolerance assumes the whole system continues to function even if the communication between partitions is unreliable.

CAP theorem states that out of these three properties, only two of them can be satisfied at the same time.

In the distributed world, partition tolerance is something that the system has to provide, hence CAP theorem describes the trade off between the consistency and availability:
- if the linearizability is required, the system becomes unavailable when different partitions get disconnected because data synchronization is required to ensure the consistency.
- if availability is the target, consistency must be sacrificed when the communication between partitions becomes unreliable since each partition needs to process the request independently and there is no guarantee for the consistency.
