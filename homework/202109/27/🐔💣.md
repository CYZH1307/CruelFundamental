# 2PL

## Shared lock and exclusive lock
- Shared lock is acquired on read events, exclusive lock is acquired for write events
- Shared lock is compatible with shared lock, exclusive lock is incompatible with any type of lock

## 2PL
- Two phase locking separate a transaction lifecycle in to two phase virtually: growing and shrinking
- During growing phase, a transaction can only acquire the compatible locks
- During shrinking phase, a transaction can only release locks, but once the releasing happens, the transaction is not allowed to acquire any new locks
- 2PL ensures the serializability of a multi-transaction schedule, since the resolution between two conflicting transaction is deterministic because no lock acquisition happens after the shrinking phase starts, so the transaction that firstly acquires the incompatible lock must complete the transaction before another.
