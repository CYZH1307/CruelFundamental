# Redis vs. Memcached

## Data Structure

In Redis, there are a few built-in data type like string, list, hash (equivalent to c++'s `map`), set (equivalent to c++'s `unordered_set`) and sorted set (equivalent to c++'s `set`). These data structures are implemented in a memory optimised way which can be helpful to make redis more than a k-v cache.

## Data Persistency

Redis supports data persistency through AOF files or RDB snapshot, so the data can be persisted and the storage becomes non-volatile. However for Memcached this seems not supported.

## Atomicity

Redis was(?) primarily using single-threaded model, so the atomicity of the operation can be achieved. This property simplifies the concurrency control and provided the user some way to implement distributed lock.
