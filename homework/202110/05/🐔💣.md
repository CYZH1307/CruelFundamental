# Concurrent Mechanism in Go

When a new concurrent job need to be executed, a new goroutine is spawned, in go runtime, a G object will be created and bound to a logical processor (P). P is a logical unit which is not physically present, so it must be attached to "real" processor, user thread. In go runtime, this is called "M". G will be waiting in the global queue or the local queue from P before it gets executed. Schedule switch the Gs that are being executed and concurrency will be achieved.

Mutex, semaphore or atomic operation can be used to ensure the synchronization between gorotuines, in go, channel is another common yet powerful way for different goroutines to communicate with each other through a flow similar to piping.
