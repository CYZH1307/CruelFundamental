- ZooKeeper is a coordination services for distributed system to manage configuration metadata, master election, crash detection, group membership, service discovery and maybe distributed lock.
- ZooKeeper provides support for consitency, ordering and synchronizatio implementation the via the client APIs.
- ZooKeeper makes use of shared storage system to implement the coordination, which is subject to the problem of communication latency, service overloading and clock drift.
- ZooKeeper consists of different roles: leaders, learners (followers and observers) and the client. Leader is the proposer, follower is the voter, observer is more like a read only cache and client is the request sender.
- ZooKeeper maintains the znodes in a tree structure and the watcher can subscribe to the changes in the znode to receive the notification.
- The Zab protocol ensures the message can be broadcast atomically between leaders and the learners, and it also ensures the new leader will be elected once the old leader crashses.
- To keep the sequence of proposals, incremental zxid is used alongside the proposal.
