# Process, Thread and Coroutine

When we are talking about **process**, it's always associated with the term "resource allocation". Process is an abstraction of the running "program", it has separate address space, page table and many other kinds of resource like identifier and environment variable, while **thread** always shares the resources with others. Thread may maintain its own context like stack and registers though.

The execution of a process indeed happens at a thread level, when CPU is scheduling the task, it manipulates the thread. Even if the process doesn't run in multithreading model, it still has the main thread for the execution and scheduling. Due to the nature of shared resources, switching between threads from the same process is more efficient than switching between threads from different process.

**Coroutine** is more like an application level concept, it follows the cooperative concurrency model, and it is scheduled by the runtime scheduler instead of handled by CPU directly. Multiple coroutines may run on a single thread and they can yield the control and resume when needed. Switching between coroutine may not even involve the kernel since the application takes the full control of the corotuines.

The simplified relationship can be visualized as
