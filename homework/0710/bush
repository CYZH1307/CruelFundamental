Overload and Overwrite
1.Overwrite
Overwrite is a method with same return type and params with its extended parent class or implemented interface.
2.Overload
Overload is same method name with different params(types, or number of params).
It's allowed to have different return type when overload.
3.could overload have different return types?
Yes.
we could refer to below example.
class A{
    void method1(int p1, int p2);
    int method2(int p);
}
when you call method in A, jvm would distinguish if you'd like to call method1 or method2 by the params you've passed.
4.why can't overwrite support different return types?
During extends/implement, you've actually taken the parents/interfaces' method in the sub calss.
If you have different return type when overwrite, it would be like below.
class A{
    String method(int p);
    int method(int p);
}
same method name, same params, sytem would have no idea wich method you'd like to call.
