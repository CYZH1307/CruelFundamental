## Redis 如何实现服务高可用？ How does Redis implement high availability of services?

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that is often used as a cache, database, or message broker. To ensure high availability, Redis implements a few strategies that enable it to recover from failures and provide continuous service to clients:

1. Master-slave replication: Redis uses a master-slave replication model, where one Redis instance acts as the master and multiple Redis instances act as slaves. The master node accepts all write operations and replicates them to the slave nodes, which then serve read requests from clients. In case the master node fails, one of the slave nodes is promoted to become the new master, ensuring that the system continues to function without any downtime.

2. Sentinel: Redis Sentinel is a high-availability and automatic failover solution that monitors Redis instances and performs automatic failover when a master node fails. Sentinel monitors the health of the Redis instances and promotes a slave node to be the new master if the current master node fails. Sentinel can also handle the promotion of a new slave to a master node if there are no other available nodes.

3. Cluster: Redis Cluster is a sharding solution that enables horizontal scaling of Redis instances across multiple nodes. It divides the data set among multiple Redis nodes, which can be added or removed from the cluster as needed, without impacting the service. If a node fails, the cluster automatically redistributes the data to the other nodes, ensuring that the data is always available.

Overall, Redis provides several mechanisms for ensuring high availability of services. By using master-slave replication, Sentinel, and Cluster, Redis can recover from failures and provide continuous service to clients.
