# Optimistic/Pessimistic Locking

## Optimistic Concurrency

The idea behind the optimism is the assumption of low data race, which can be quite common in read heavy system. In optimistic concurrency, all the operations that need to access a shared resource can be happening concurrently. However, when the operation is about to modify the resource, it checks if the data is dirty, and abort the whole transaction if so.

### Versioning

Before write operation, version tag (or counter, timestamp) can be used to track if the data is still the same snapshot when the transaction starts. However the version comparison and data modification should be atomic.

### CAS

Compare-and-swap makes use of the low level OS support for the atomic compare and set operation to provide the synchronization control. This is usually applied to some primitive type so the use case could be limited. In Go, `sync/atomic` package is a wrapper providing some useful function to implement CAS. ABA problem is a common issue with for CAS so it needs to be used with caution.

## Pessimistic Concurrency

On the other hand, pessimistic concurrency control assume high chance of data race, thus requiring explicit locking mechanism to ensure the single access of shared resources. This is more commonly seen in write heavy system, if optimistic locking is applied by mistake, there might be a lot of rollback and abortion, which has a negative impact on the performance.
