# Bloom Filter

The main problem bloom filter is trying to solve is how to efficiently determine if an element exists, here false positive is acceptable but false negative is not.

A traditional method would be using hash map, which essentially stores all the existing elements in the hash buckets with some conflict resolution. However, if the number of elements is far larger than the memory can hold, we need some better way to store the information with less space requirement.

Bloom filter is similar to a hash map, which maintains a fixed size hash bucket list, when insert an element, we calculate the hash value and mark the value on in the hash bucket. Usually, to minimize the conflict, multiple different hash functions are used to produce different value and all the bits will be marked on. Whenever we need to determine if a value exists, the same hash functions are applied and the bucket for the result will be checked. If all the bits are on then it means the value exists (with the possibility of wrong assertion here though).

This is particularly helpful in some scenario that we need to determine if some value doesn't exist and reject the request earlier instead of letting the traffic to hit the database.
