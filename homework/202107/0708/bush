GC
1. Basically There are Four Types of GC Roots
local variables
active threads
static variables
JNI references

2. CMS(Concurrent Mark Sweep) only for OLD Space, use 3-color marking
CMS has 4 steps
1> initial mark
STW and collect all root objects.
*during CMS, all objects in young space would be treated as GC roots.
2> concurrent mark
Concurrenttly mark live objects in old space.
*Incremental Update
3> finial remark
STW and do full marking(root scanning & recursive traversal), because object could be changed in step 2.
This step would take a long time.
4> sweep
Scan the whole old space and reclaim space of unreachable objects

3.G1(Garbage First) for ALL Space, use SATB(Snapshot-At-The-Beginning)
G1 is targeted for multiprocessors with large memories, and would have a higher throughput compared to CMS.
The CMS algo could lead to fragmentation, and have to do full GC while there are enough space in old space, which makes GC unpredictable.
G1 separate the old space into several regions and copy one region to another to cut down the fragmentation.
